# Data Foundry Service

Data Foundry is a local control plane for producing TianGong-ready TIDAS data from external source material.

## Scope

Supported production lanes:

- `external-dataset-curated-import`: packaged LCA datasets converted and schema-validated through unified Rust `tidas`.
- `source-evidence-dataset-development`: PDF, Excel, web exports, screenshots, or free text authored into TIDAS candidate data with explicit source evidence.

Foundry owns:

- task intake and filesystem queue state;
- workspace creation under `.foundry/workspaces/<task-id>/`;
- capability route plans;
- artifact manifests and reports;
- policy checks and handoff records;
- gate aggregation across owner-produced artifacts.

Foundry does not own:

- TIDAS schemas, YAML methodology, or runtime rulesets;
- source package parsing/conversion and schema-validation engines;
- AI authoring implementation;
- external source-evidence research skills;
- deterministic QA engines;
- curation queue state machines;
- database write semantics.

Those capabilities belong in Rust `tidas`, `tidas-sdk`, `tiangong-lca-cli`, `tiangong-lca-skills`, external runtime skill repositories such as `tiangong-ai/skills`, Edge Functions, database, or calculator projects.

## Required Artifacts

Every import task should produce:

- contract context manifest for each target TIDAS type;
- runtime skill resolution manifest when an external source-evidence skill is used;
- source package or source document manifest;
- conversion report or source extraction report;
- CLI curation queue build/next/verify reports;
- Rust tidas batch-validation evidence, Foundry compatibility validation reports, and CLI QA reports;
- repair queue or explicit blocker report when validation fails;
- dry-run publish/import plan before any remote write;
- write policy, account guard, commit handoff, and verification/readback artifacts when remote writes are profile-gated and explicitly in scope.
