# HiQLCD ILCD Reference Delivery Gaps

This archive records delivery-closure problems in `inputs/HIQ-ILCD`. It intentionally separates package reference gaps from the deterministic converter capabilities that existed when this archive was written. Any old Python converter references are historical evidence; current reusable import/conversion/validation capabilities belong in Rust tidas.

Current package shape:

- `processes`: 10 XML files.
- `flows`: 4,332 XML files.
- `flowproperties`: 8 XML files.
- `unitgroups`: 7 XML files.
- `contacts`: 1 XML file.
- `sources`: missing; no `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/sources/` directory is delivered.
- `lciamethods`: 762 XML files, apparently sidecar LCIA method exports rather than process import closure.

The 121 process exchange flow references are locally closed: they reference 21 unique flow datasets, and every referenced flow exists under `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/flows/`. The reference delivery problem is therefore not "the ILCD parser cannot read exchanges"; the hard gaps are missing source datasets and missing background providers.

## HIQ-REF-001: Missing True Source Dataset Delivery

| Field | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Issue type | Reference delivery gap; true source rows are absent. |
| Affected objects | All 10 process datasets need true source attribution before TIDAS write planning. Three two-step process datasets additionally carry repeated inline source UUID hints for `0eb0c1f6-05aa-4a5a-9599-1d0444b8f640`, version `1.2.0`. |
| Evidence location | `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/sources/` is absent. Two-step source UUID hint examples: `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/processes/2937aa4a-4339-4534-ade6-9b76cb2caf1c.xml:60`, `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/processes/2937aa4a-4339-4534-ade6-9b76cb2caf1c.xml:63`, `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/processes/55d6ddfa-e306-42a4-b4bc-61cdf7c1e164.xml:62`, `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/processes/55d6ddfa-e306-42a4-b4bc-61cdf7c1e164.xml:75`. Generic source hints without source dataset rows appear in comments such as `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/processes/9c864d02-025d-46e4-98c3-96ac58cb863b.xml:58`. |
| Impact | Foundry `WORKFLOW.md` stage 17 requires source rows to be true reports, publications, or traceable source records. A generated placeholder such as `ILCD format` is not acceptable as process `referenceToDataSource`. |
| Suggested handling | First query remote/source registry for source UUID `0eb0c1f6-05aa-4a5a-9599-1d0444b8f640` version `1.2.0`. In parallel ask the data provider to deliver the missing `sources/` export or an openLCA JSON-LD export. If neither is available, author source rows from explicit literature citations only where the process comments provide enough bibliographic evidence. Use any database-level fallback only after a HiQLCD profile policy defines the fallback citation and its scope. |
| Blocks import? | Yes for final database write. Conversion can continue as an investigation artifact, but process write planning should remain blocked until true-source strategy is resolved. |

Two-step process source UUID hint inventory:

| Process UUID | Process file | Reference flow | Source hint occurrences | Evidence examples | Resolution path |

## HIQ-REF-002: Background Default Providers Are Mostly Not Delivered

| Field | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Issue type | Reference delivery gap; background process/default provider references point outside the package. |
| Affected objects | 96 `olca:defaultProvider` attributes across process exchanges; 95 point to 13 unique provider UUIDs that are not delivered under `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/processes/`. |
| Evidence location | Examples: `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/processes/2937aa4a-4339-4534-ade6-9b76cb2caf1c.xml:53` for steam provider `f67a7086-48c1-3a3c-ab44-e06838ca2c8f`; `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/processes/9c864d02-025d-46e4-98c3-96ac58cb863b.xml:104` for natural gas provider `c87bafe0-08bd-497e-8c8e-1895e694b72e`; `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/processes/826beb40-f152-4dd2-be5f-0788235b1691.xml:51` for truck transport provider `bf17bd7d-b5ef-4468-956d-ea05cc4ab8ee`. |
| Impact | The package represents foreground unit processes plus provider pointers to missing background processes. A closed process import cannot silently treat those provider UUIDs as local processes. |
| Suggested handling | Query remote TianGong/openLCA source by provider UUID where available; otherwise create a manual background mapping table from source flow/provider UUID to existing TianGong process/flow identities. If provider identities cannot be resolved, preserve them as unresolved external provider trace and keep affected process scopes blocked or policy-deferred. |
| Blocks import? | Blocks closed, fully linked process import. A profile may allow foreground-only import with unresolved provider trace, but that is a deliberate fallback policy, not adapter behavior. |

## HIQ-REF-003: LCIA Methods And Unreferenced Flows Are Sidecar Payload, Not Process Closure

| Field | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Issue type | Package normalization/cropping issue; not a missing-reference blocker. |
| Affected objects | 762 `lciamethods/*.xml` files and 4,311 flow datasets that are not referenced by the 10 process exchange lists. |
| Evidence location | LCIA method count under `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/lciamethods/`; example LCIA method `inputs/HIQ-ILCD/lciamethods/a49af9c2-63a4-3df3-be18-06685c6bd216.xml:1-33`. The process exchange closure uses 21 unique flow UUIDs, leaving 4,311 unreferenced flows. |
| Impact | Importing the entire directory naively would pull LCIA method sidecars and thousands of unused elementary flows into the task scope, inflating curation and identity work without improving the 10 process closures. |
| Suggested handling | Use process-reachable cropping for HiQLCD import workspaces: keep the 10 processes, their 21 referenced flows, required flow properties/unit groups/contacts, and source/provider trace. Retain the full package as immutable source evidence, but do not treat sidecar LCIA methods or unreferenced flows as import-ready support dependencies. |
| Blocks import? | No. This is a scope-control requirement for normalization, not a data-delivery blocker. |
